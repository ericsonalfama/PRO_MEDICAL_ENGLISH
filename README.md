# OET Preparation Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is a dynamic and responsive landing page designed to promote the OET (Occupational English Test) preparation course for healthcare professionals. Built with modern web technologies, it features engaging elements like testimonials and course progress tracking to enhance user experience.

## Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- **Dynamic Testimonials Section**: Fetches student testimonials dynamically using JavaScript, allowing for easy updates without modifying HTML.
- **Carousel Functionality**: Custom-built carousel for testimonials, enabling smooth transitions between reviews.
- **Progress Tracking Timeline**: Horizontal timeline indicating the course structure and progress, dynamically rendered using data from `data.js`.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Placeholder integration for future real-time notifications regarding course updates and exam schedules.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core technologies used to structure, style, and add interactivity.
- **Modular Data Loading**: Data for testimonials and course progress is loaded dynamically from `data.js`, making the page content easily updatable.
- **Custom JavaScript Carousel**: No third-party libraries like Bootstrap or Swiper; all functionality is built with vanilla JavaScript.

## Integration with WordPress/Elementor
- The design can be seamlessly integrated into an existing WordPress site using Elementor by:
  - **Custom HTML Widget**: Embedding the entire HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a custom HTML widget in Elementor.
  - **Style Adjustments**: Ensuring styles align with the site's existing design by utilizing Elementor's theme editor for typography and spacing adjustments.
  - **Modular Structure**: The use of modular JavaScript and CSS makes it easy to incorporate additional WordPress functionality as needed.
